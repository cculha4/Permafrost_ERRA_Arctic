GeoBasis Disko - Hydrology - RE-WaterDischarge_15min
Water discharge in Røde Elv (RE) is based on water level registrations and a relation between measured discharge (Q) and water level (h). The Q/h relation is made in close collaboration with Asiaq, Greenland Survey. The timestamp of the calculated discharge data are West Greenland Time (UTC-3). Data was calculated for every 10 minutes up to 2017 (WaterDischarge_10min). From 2017 and onwards the time step was 15 minutes. Data cover the main runoff season. However, the start and the end of the annual time series refer to the time when the automatic sensors were deployed and removed from the water. For a better estimation of the break-up and freeze-in period, please contact the GeoBasis Disko data manager. The drainage basin of this Røde Elv site is approximately 100 km2 and varies in elevation from 0-800 m above sea level.
