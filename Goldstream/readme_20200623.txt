    ===============================
    == Data Collection Procedure ==
    ===============================
        A Freewave FGR series 900 MHz radio network was installed  for automated data retrieval.  
		Additionally, cellular telemetry was installed at various stations. Data is also collected 
		locally/manually during stations visits, which occur several times annually.  

    ====================================================
    == Derived Parameters and Mathematical Operations ==
    ====================================================

        Soil Temperatures are logged with units of both resistance in kilo-Ohms and temperature in degrees C.  On the logger the 
milli-Volt signal of the sensors are converted to resistance.  

        Snow signal is recorded as distance in centimeters to ground / snow surface.  Sensor distance to 
ground is recalculated every fall.

    =====================
    == Parameter units ==
    =====================
      Radiation: Watts per meter squared
      Temperature: Degrees Celsius
      Relative Humidity: Percent
      Precipitation: millimeters of water
      Snow Depth: centimeters of snow
      Wind Speed: meters per second
      Wind Direction: degrees
      Soil Moisture: Percent 
      Stage: feet or meters above datum 
      Discharge: cubic meters per second

Generally the quality of the meteorological data is thought to be good.  

During the summer months, the tipping bucket raingage at GSM3 and GSM4 become clogged with debris/leaves for several weeks, recorded rainfall is thought to be less than actual during 
these periods, use data with caution and compare to another source.   

During the late fall, winter and early  spring air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction sensors can all experience rime ice or 
freezing precipitation.  When this occurs the data collected by these sensors may be adversely affected.  

Snow depth (SR50) data was problematic in 2018, with many erratic and outlier values.  Many of these were removed from the dataset.

Air temperature in fall 2015 to spring 2016 at GSM2, GSM3, GSM4 is using YSI backup thermistor because the HC2S3 sensor was incorrectly programed.

Measurements of discharge are made using a tethered ADCP during high flow and hand held flow meter and wading rod during periods of low flow. At times during
spring breakup, measurements were made under ice and above ice.
Rating curves are developed to estimate river discharge during non ice affected conditions.  The stage is plotted against discharge and a best fit curve is fitted 
through the data points and represented by an equation.  We attempt to collect discharge at various river stage to have a good relationship at all river stage.  
Extrapolation for very low and very high flow occurs due to the lack of measurements in these ranges.  Data quality at lower discharge and highest discharge may not be as accurate.
Beaver activity in the vicinity of Goldstream at Ballaine Road caused problematic
water level data, making the rating curve invalid.  Caution should be used using data at this site.

Sensor outages occur periodically due to animal damage and equipment failure.

Position information recorded in the field using a GPS (WGS84).  Elevation information estimated from topographic 
maps (NAD27 or NAD83/WGS84).
